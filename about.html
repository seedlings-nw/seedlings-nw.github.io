                                    Hi! I'm <i>Angel Abad</i>.
                                    I'm the founder of Seedlings. 


                                    I love plants ðŸ˜Š

                                    I was born in the Philippines, and I have six siblings. I have four adorable dogs. I relocated from 
                                    California to the Pacific Northwest. I have been in the plant business for six years. This began as a 
                                    hobby but quickly evolved into a business. I am always on the lookout for new and unique plants. I enjoy 
                                    developing customer relationships. I am also a brand manager and a social media influencer. I am very 
                                    active on social media and TikTok.


                                    Seedlings are the result of my love of plants and my desire to help others love plants as well! One of my 
                                    absolute favorite aspects of working in this community is meeting amazing plant enthusiasts like you!


                                    Because all of our customers are important, our professional staff is dedicated to making your experience 
                                    a pleasant one.
